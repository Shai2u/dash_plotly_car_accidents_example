# Building a Dashboard with a Map: Step-by-Step Using Dash-Plotly and Dash-Leaflet

In this post, I’ll walk you through building a dashboard with a map step by step, using Dash-Plotly and Dash-Leaflet. Whether you’re a beginner or intermediate data scientist, this guide will help you explore how to combine interactive visualizations with geographic data in a user-friendly interface.

Here’s what we’ll cover in this tutorial:
	1.	Building a Complex Dashboard Step by Step: Learn to create a functional, interactive dashboard by designing it from scratch. We’ll walk through adding elements step by step, implementing callback interactivity, and applying styling to make it polished and user-friendly.
	2.	Working with Geographic Data: Understand the basics of Dash-Leaflet for adding spatial data to your dashbaord.
	3.	Best Practices in Python: Incorporate good coding practices to make your dashboard maintainable and scalable.
	4.	Dash-Plotly Tricks: Simplify some challenging aspects of Dash-Plotly with helpful tips and techniques. 

The dashboard we’ll build will provide statistical insights and map visualizations related to car accidents in Israel.

If you’re a data scientist exploring web technologies, Dash-Plotly offers a fantastic starting point for building interactive dashboards and applications. Dash-Plotly is essentially a Python framework built on React and Flask, combining frontend interactivity with Python’s simplicity. Here’s why it’s worth learning:
1. HTML and CSS Basics: Dash uses common tags as in HTML, it's an opportunity to learn foundational web design concepts for structuring and styling web-apps.
2. React Potential: Dash is a Python wrapper to React. Basicly it acts as a bridge to understanding React. You can quickly prototype ideas and later dive deeper into React’s capabilities.
3. Flask Framework: Since Dash is built on Flask, it introduces you to one of Python’s most popular frameworks for creating APIs and integrating frontend and backend functionalities.
4. Coding Practice: Unlike platforms like Tableau or Power BI, Dash requires you to code your dashboards, providing more flexibility and customization. However, this also means that your code can quickly become cumbersome and difficult to manage. Dash offers an opportunity to practice/learn writing clean, organized, and maintainable code—skills that are crucial for developing scalable and efficient applications.
5. Deployment Opportunities: Dash applications can be deployed on platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP, giving you hands-on experience in web deployment.
6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Building a dashboard involves data wrangling, cleaning, and exploration—core skills for any data scientist. Dash makes EDA interactive and engaging.
7. Beyond Dashboards: Dash isn’t just for dashboards; it can power simulations, prototypes, or custom data-driven applications. Check out the Dash-Plotly Gallery for inspiration.


The added advantages of learning dash-plotly


An important consideration in creation of a dashbaord is planning in advance the executationl steps
Here is the breakdown of the steps:
1. Sketching the intial concept of the, basicly what we want to showcase.
2. Placing the static plotly elements in the layout
3. 


The soruce of the data comes from accdients dataset From data.gov.il (Israel open soruce govemenral data website),
The data has been processed and translated to enlgish in order to simplify the process.

So without further due lets start learning how to build the dashboard step by step.

1. Sketching the inital concept of the dashboard,

```python
from dash import Dash, html
import plotly.express as px

app = Dash()


cell_style = {'padding': '20px',
              'text-align': 'center'}

# Set the layout right the first time!
app.layout = html.Div(
    style={
        'display': 'grid',
        'gridTemplateColumns': '33% 33% 33%',
        'gridTemplateRows': '20% 40% 40%',
        'gap': '10px',
        'height': '100vh',
        'width': '100vw',
    },
    children=[
        html.Div('Title', style={
                 'backgroundColor': 'lightblue', **cell_style}),
        html.Div('Filters', style={
                 'backgroundColor': 'lightgreen', 'gridColumn': 'span 2', **cell_style}),
        html.Div('Main Map', style={'backgroundColor': 'lightcoral',
                 **cell_style, 'gridColumn': 'span 2', 'gridRow': 'span 2'}),
        html.Div(['Graph with Filed Selection'], style={
                 'backgroundColor': 'lightgoldenrodyellow', **cell_style}),
        html.Div(['Env Map'], style={
                 'backgroundColor': 'lightpink', **cell_style})
    ]
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
