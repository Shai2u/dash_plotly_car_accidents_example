# Building a Dashbord with a map step by step using dash-plotly and dash-leaflet

In this post I will show you how to build a dashboard with a map step by step using dash-plotly and 
dash-leaflet.


As a data-scientist who is learning web-technology, there are numerous advantages of learning dahs-plotly.
Dash-plotly is a basicly a python wrapper to react built upon a flask framework. The added benfits of udnerstanindng and practicing dash-plotly:
1. Knoweldge in HTML and CSS wich is essential in building frontend websites, and styling it.
2. Since Dash is a wrapper of the powerfull react framework, Dash is perfect for those (like me) who are practicing react but want to quickly excetute a prototype before, in other words knowing dash-plotly is very good stop in learning react and knowing it's potential.
3. Dash utilizes the flaks framework another important python framework for integrating front and back-end as well as building APIS
4. Dash dahsboards or apps could very quickly get complex, The scucess of building a good dashboard or in some is to apply best python practice such as applying the PEP-8 style guide.
5. Dash apps could be deployed on the web so this is also an opportunity to learn about deployment in various platforms such as AWS, Azure, GCP or DigitalOcean.
6. It goes without saying that the source of a good dasbbord is it's data, whenever you build a dashbord (and it doesn't matter in what platform), you eventually would go through the process of of data wrangeling, cleaning, enhancing and exploring. so dash-plotly (or any other dashbord platofrm) is an excelelnt way to perfrom Exploritory data analysis (EDA)
7. Unlike simplified dashboard creation platofrm (such as PowerBI or Tableau) the help you build dashboards quickly with almost no code, To build a dashboard in dash you will need to code it, yes you will get your hands dirty here, but using code the amount of costimization is much greater compared to the mentioned BI (buisness inteligence) apps, with dash you can do so much more than an advance dashboard, you could build a simulation, or even prototype application design, for example see dash-plotly gallery.


The added advantages of learning dash-plotly


An important consideration in creation of a dashbaord is planning in advance the executationl steps
Here is the breakdown of the steps:
1. Sketching the intial concept of the, basicly what we want to showcase.
2. Placing the static plotly elements in the layout
3. 


The soruce of the data comes from accdients dataset From data.gov.il (Israel open soruce govemenral data website),
The data has been processed and translated to enlgish in order to simplify the process.

So without further due lets start learning how to build the dashboard step by step.
